# Tansive

**Open platform for Policy-Driven, Auditable, Secure AI Agents**

Tansive is a developer- and ops-friendly platform for building, executing, and governing AI agents and tools with declarative workflows and fine-grained policies.

Whether you are automating tasks that touch sensitive systems, creating AI agents that securely access multiple systems to gather precise context, or building new workflows on top of existing data, Tansive provides the foundation to deploy and run them safely while meeting compliance requirements.

Tansive is not another agent framework. It's agnostic to frameworks and languages. Bring your own agents and toolsâ€”written in any language, using any interface, and Tansive will chain them together, enforce fine-grained policies, and manage their lifecycle.

## âœ¨ Key Features

- **Declarative Agent Catalog**  
  Hierarchically structured repository of agents, tools, and contextual data, partitioned across environments like dev, stage, and prod, and across namespaces for teams or components.

- **Runtime Policy Enforcement**  
  Enforce fine-grained controls over access, execution, and data flows. Every agent and tool invocation is checked against policies in real time.

- **Immutable Constraints and Transforms**  
  Pin runtime sessions to specific values and apply user-defined transforms to filter or modify input securely.

- **Tamper-Evident Audit Logging**  
  Hash-linked, signed logs of every action for observability, compliance, and forensic analysis.

- **Language and Framework Agnostic**  
  Author tools and agents in any languageâ€”Python, Bash, Go, Node.js - no mandatory SDKs or special runtime servers.

- **GitOps Friendly**  
  Configure everything via declarative YAML specs version-controlled in Git, modeled on familiar cloud-native patterns.
